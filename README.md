Formula 1 REST API — COMP 4513 Assignment 1

This project is a Formula 1 REST API built using Node.js, Express, and Supabase. It was built using our lab14b as a skeleton, hence the appearance of "lab14b" here and there.  
It provides multiple endpoints to retrieve F1 data such as races, results, drivers, and constructors.  
The API is hosted on Render, and was developed as part of COMP 4513 – Web Services and Cloud-Based Systems.
